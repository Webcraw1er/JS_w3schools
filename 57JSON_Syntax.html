1. JSON syntax is a subset of the JS syntax.
    1) data is in name:value pairs. (key: value pairs)
    2) data is seperated by commas.
    3) curly braces hold objects.
    4) square brackets hold arrays.

2. A name/value pair consists of a field name, followed by a colon, then followed by a value.
    JSON names require double quotes.

    in JSON:
        {"name": "John"}
    in Javascript:
        {name: "John"}

    in JSON values must be one of these types: 
        a string
        a number
        an object
        an array
        a boolean
        null
    plus, JS has the following types in addition:
        a function
        a date
        undefined.
            these are the types of which JSON CAN'T BE.
            

3. JS arrays can also be written as JSON.
