1. there are three types of scopes.
    1) block scopes
    2) function scopes
    3) global scopes

    Before ES6(2015), there was nothing as block scope.
    BUT as "let" and "const" are introduced, the two keywords made it nessessary for 
    the notation of "Block scope" to emerge.
        
        variables declared inside a { } block cannot


2. anything declared inside a function has a function scope, 
    only accessable in the function.

3. Like you learned in the low-level languages, function scope variables are created with the start 
    of the function and deleted upon completion of it.

4. HOWEVER UNLIKE C, any variable declared outside the function or { } has a global scope.
    IN c, declaring a variable in the main function doesnt make it global.
    So its the matter of a "shell".
    in C, the most outer shell is the page itself, outside the main function.
    in JS, the most outershell is either <head> or <body>, when something goes outside of those,
         they are invisible to JS and therefore unreadable.

5. Shoking news: if you  assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, 
    it AUTOMATICALLY becomes global.

6. in JS, the global scope is the JS environment.
    in HTML, the global scope is the window object.
    
    so global variables defined with "var" belong to the window object.
        ex) var carNAme= "volvo";
            // code here can use window.carName.
    however "let" variables does not belong to the window object.
       ex) var carNAme= "volvo";
            // code here CANNOT use window.carName.

    DO not create global variables unless you intend to.
        your global variables can overwrite window variables( or functions)

    Function arguments(variables) work as local variables inside the function.
