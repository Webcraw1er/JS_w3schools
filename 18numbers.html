<!--
1. numbers in JS: number(fraction) is stored in 0~ 51, exponent in 52~ 62, and sign bit as 63.
    as you know, 10 bits store about a kilobyte(1000), so the python number is accurate upto 15 digits.

    maximum will be 17 digits.

2. because of this(not having a specific num type and ahaving a bunch of digits) python num are
    not always accurate.

    and it helps to multiply and divide with certain numbers.

3. Js always interprets numeric contents.
    so it tries to convert the string conetent into numbers when NUMERIC OPERATIONS are given.

        however the + operator is both addition and concatenation operator in Js, 
        so if given 
            let w= "100";
            let q= "10";
            document.write("<br>" + w + q);
        it will only concatenate them as strings.

4. NaN:         not a number.
    let x= 100/ "apple"; 
    document.write(x);
        하면 NaN 이 뜸. 왜냐 넘버가 아닌니까.

    isNaN():    determines if the given parameter is a number.
    NaN is a number.
    typeof NaN returns "number".
    
5. infinity: shit you get when you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.
    
6. when proceeded by 0x, JS interprets the number as hexadecimal.
    JS displays numbers as decimals by default.
    However the .toString() method converts and outputs numbers from base 2 to base 64.


7. if you make a number object with new keyword like let num1= new Number(500),
    they become objects.

        let num2=500;
    then num1== num2 is true, 
    but num1===num2 isn't.
    
    btw comparing two JS objects is always false.
