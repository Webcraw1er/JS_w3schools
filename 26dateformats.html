1. Dates in JS has three types:
    1) ISO Date         "2015-03-14"    <--- this is the ISO 8601 date, the most popular one.
    2) Short Date       "03/25/2014"
    3) Long Date        "25 Mar 2015" or "Mar 25 2015"

        the ISO format follows the strict standard in JS.
        others, they are not so well defined and might be browser specific.

    independent of the input format, the Js will output dates as full text string format.

    Unlike the normal 
        new Date();
    the ISO dates can be written as only year, 
        ex) new Date("2015");
    because it is a string.

2. ISO dates can be written with added hours, minutes, and seconds.
        ex) (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ);
    "날짜" 와 "시간" 부분들은 T로 나뉘어진다.
    UTC 시간임을 나타내기 위해 Z를 붙인다.
    UTC에 의거하여 시간을 바꾸고 싶다면, Z를 떼어내고 +HH:MM 이나 -HH:MM 를 붙인다.

    both the date input and output will be modified according to your browser.

3. remember that the parse() method is a built-in method of the library "Date()", 
    so it cannot be used with your own variable.
    only write Date.parse()
