<!--
1. variables declared with "let" keyword cannot be redeclared.
    let x= 56;
    let x= "John Doe"
    raises an error.

2. variables defined with let must be declared before use.

3. let has a block scope.
    variables declared inside the { } block cannoy be accessed from outside the block.

    { let x= 10; }
    let x= "John Doe";
    document.write(x);
        -> this code runs good.
    
    { let x= 10; }
    document.write(x);
        -> raises error: x not defined.

    HOWEVER, VAR does not have a block scope.
    it can also be redeclared, so the redeclaration can appear on anywhere of the code.

    { var x= 10; }
    let x= "John Doe";
    document.write(x);
        -> runs good.

    { var x= 10; }
    document.write(x);
        -> runs good.

4. redeclaring:
    just remember that if using "let", those two are totally different variables.
    when using "var", those two are one; because "var" is not block level.

    so you can go with var anywhere, and let if you do this:
    let x=10;
    {let x= 2; } 
    {let x= 5; }

    this is totally fine.

5. Hoisting means that 
        Former to the execution, the program seperates the declaration and initialization,
        and only the declarations goes to the top of the code.

        AS A RESULT, if you did declare the variable somewhere in the code, you are free to 
                    use it before declaring it first.

        Let is also hoisted, but not initialized, 
            -> which means that using it will raise an reference error.
