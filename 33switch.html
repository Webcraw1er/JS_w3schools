<!--
1. How this works
    1) THe switch exp is evaluated only once.
    2) the value of the exp is compared with the values of each case.
    3) if there is a match, the assossiated block of code is executed.
    4) IF THERE IS NO MATCH, the "default" code block is executed.

2. IMPORTANCE OF "BREAK"
    IF YOU OMIT IT, the next case will be executed even if the evalaution does not match the case.

3. Common code blocks
    in the example 3, case 4 and case 5 shares the same code. 
        if the switch evaluation evaluates as 4 or 5, the same code will be executed.
    so does case 6 and case 0.
    
4. other switching details
    If multiple cases match the evaluation, only the first case is selected.
    If no cases match the evaluation AND there is no default block, the switch statement
        carries on to the next existing statements(if there is any).

5. the switch comparison uses the "===" operator.
    the values must match, AND be of the same type.
