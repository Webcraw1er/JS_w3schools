<!--
1. const cannot be reassigned.
    const PI= 3.1415;
    PI= 3.14;           <- this raises an error
    PI= PI+10;          <- this raises an error/

2. const must be assigned a value when it is declared. 
    const PI;
    PI= 3.14;       <-- error

3. const is a little misleading.
    it DOES NOT define a constant value. 
    it DEFINES A constant reference to a value.

    So you can:
        change the elements of a constant array
        change the properties of constant object.
    BUT YOU CANNOT:
        REASSIGN A CONSTANT VALUE.
        REASSIGN A CONSTANT ARRAY.
        REASSIGN A CONSTANT OBJECT.
