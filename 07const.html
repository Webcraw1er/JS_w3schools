1. const cannot be reassigned.
    const PI= 3.1415;
    PI= 3.14;           <- this raises an error
    PI= PI+10;          <- this raises an error/

2. const must be assigned a value when it is declared. 
    const PI;
    PI= 3.14;       <-- error

3. const is a little misleading.
    it DOES NOT define a constant value. 
    it DEFINES A constant reference to a value.

    So you can:
        change the elements of a constant array
        change the properties of constant object.
    BUT YOU CANNOT:
        REASSIGN A CONSTANT VALUE.
        REASSIGN A CONSTANT ARRAY. 
            ex) cars= ["audi", "sonata"];
                cars= ["bentz", "audi"];  <--- this will raise an error. 
        REASSIGN A CONSTANT OBJECT.

4. const is block level.
    `   same as others. shares the mostly same characteristics with "let".

5. const is also hoisted to the top., but also not initialized. just like "let".
