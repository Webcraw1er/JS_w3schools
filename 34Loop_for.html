1. Js loop serves different purposes.
    for             loops through a block of code a number of times.
    for in          loops through the properties of an object.
    for of          loops through the values of an iterable object.
    while           loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
    do while        same as above.

    1) for loop 
        for( statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) { code block }   
            statement 1 is executed (only once), before the execution of code block.
            statement 2 defiens the condition for executing the code block.
            statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

            statement 1 is optional. 
                you can initiate multiple values, or can even initiate no variables at all.

            statement 2 is also optional. 
                the for loop will go on as long as statement 2 is true.
                so if you omit statement 2, you must provide "break;" to prevent infinite loop.
            
            statement 3 is optional.
                you can omit this, or even do decrements or subtractions.
                    ex) y-= 15;
                
        all the variables provided inside the for loop is block scope; they will be only visible
        inside the for loop.
