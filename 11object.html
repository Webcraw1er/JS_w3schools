<!-- 
1. in real life a car is an object, which has a property that varies from car to car, and
    has methods like start, brake, and stop.

2. an object is made to contain many values in one variable.
    the values are written as name: value pairs.

    a method is a function stored as a property.
            is  an action that can be performed on objects.
            is stored in properties as function definitions

3. accessing object properties
    in two ways: 
        objectName.propertyName
    or
        objectName["propertyName"]

4. ABOUT <THIS>
    1) in an object method, this refers to the object.
    2) Alone, this refers to the global object.
    3) In a function, this refers to the global object.
    4) In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
    5) methods like call(), apply(), and bind{() can refer this to any object.

        this is not a variable, its a keyword. you cannot change the value of this.
        In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
        In the example above, this is the "name object" that "owns" the fullName function.
        In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of "this object".
