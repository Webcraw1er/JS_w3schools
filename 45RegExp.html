<!--
1. regular expression is a sequence of character that forms a search pattern.
    The search patterns are used for text search and replace operations.
    You can use these patterns to describe what you are searching for.

2. syntax
        /pattern/modifiers;
        ex) /w3schools/i;
                -> means "find the string 'w3schools' regardless of the case sensitivity.

3. search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
            can also be used with a string as a pattern.
    replace() method returns a modified string whewre the pattern is replaced.
        
4. RegExp 
    1) modifiers: 
        i           perform case insensitive matching
        g           perform global match(find all matches.)
        m           perform multiple matching.
    
    2) patterns
        (1) brackets
                can be used to find a range of characters.
                    [abc]       find any of the characters between the brackets.
                    [0-9]       find        "
                    (x|y)       find any of the alternatives seperated with |.
        (2) metacharacters
                are characters with a special meaning.
                    \d          find a digit
                        ex) above.
                    \s          find a white space charcter.
                    \b          find a match at the beginning of a word like this: /\bRandomWord/g
                                        or at the end of a word like this: /randomWord\b/g
        (3) quantifiers
                define quantities.
                    n+          matches any strings that contains at least one n
                    n*          matches any strings that contains zero or more occcurances of n
                    n?          matches any strings that contains zero or one occcurances of n 
                    
                    remember that the quantifiers only define the quantity of the previous ONE word,
                    so if you write 
                        /o+/g,
                    it picks every single "o"s, like "o", "oo", "ooo"... so on.
                    but if you write 
                        /lo+/g,
                    it picks those that starts with l and has some o's after that.

5. test() method
        is a regExp expression method.
        searches a string for a pattern, and returns true or false, depending on the result.
        for ex), 
            const pattern= /e/;
            pattern.test("the best things in life are free!");
        searches a string for the char, "e", and returns "true".
        this can also be written as:
            /e/.test("the best things in life are free!");
            
    exec() method
        searches a string for a specified pattern, and returns the found text 
        as an OBJECT!
        so you can use various built-in object methods.
