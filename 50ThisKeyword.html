<!--
1. example first:
    const person= {
            firstname: "John",
            lastname: "Doe",
            id: 5566,
            fullname: function() {
            return this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
            }
        };

        document.write(person.fullname())


        document.write(person.fullname()) will print out
            John Doe
        document.write(person.fullname) will print out
            function() { return this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname; },
                which is the definition of the function.
        
2. the "this" keyword refers to an object.(different object depending on how it is used.
        1) in an object method, refers to the object.
        2) ALone, refers to the global object. (in a browser window the global object is [object window])
        3) in a function, refers to the global object.
        4) in strict mode, in a function, is undefined.
        5) In an event, refers to the element that received the event.
        6) Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
                    ->  this is called explicit function binding
            # the call() and bind() functions are predefined JS methods.
              they can both be used to call an object method with another method as argument.

            the example 
                2.6 call()
            above calls person1.fullNamewith person2 as an argument, "this" refers to 
            person2, even if fulName is a method of person1

            the example
                2.6 bind()
            shows how the name2 object borrows the printName method from the name1 object.

        remember that "this" is not a variable, it is a keyword. the value of this can not be changed.

3. "this" keyword precedence
        1. bind()
        2. apply() and call()
        3. object method
        4. global scope
