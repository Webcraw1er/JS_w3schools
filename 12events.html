1. html events are things that happen to html elements.
    Js will react to these events.

2. Events can be things the browser does, or a user does.
    ex) html page has finished loading
        html inout field is changed.
        html button is clicked.

    HTML ALLOWS EVENT HANDLER ATTRIBUTES, WITH "JAVASCRIPT CODE" TO BE ADDED TO HTML ELEMENTS.

3. YOU SEE, the <button> element has a content as its value.
            however the <input> has a "value" attribute.
            so the "onclick"  must change the innerHTML(contnent) of the former, 
            but "value" of the latter.   

4. HTMl events:
    onchange        an html element has been changed.
    onclick         the user clicks an element.
    onmouseover     user moves mouse over an html element.
    onmouseout      user moves mouse away from element.
    onkeydown       user pushes a keyboard key.
    onload          browser has finished loading a page.

        according to the events, what html does varies.
    EVENT HANDLERS   can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and brower actions.
        ex) things that should be done evry tiem a page loads.
            things that should be done when page closes.
            action that should be performed when a button is clicked.
            contents that should be verified when a user inputs data.

    many different methods can be used to let JAVASCIPT work with events.
        ex) HTML EVENT ATTRIBUTES can execute js code directly.
                                  can call JS functions.
            you can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements.
            you can prevent events from eing sent or being handled.
