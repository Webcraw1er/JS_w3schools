<!--

1. With a "Boolean()" function, you can figure out true/false value of any types of variables.

2. Any variable with a "value" is considered "TRUE".
    an empty string ""                          <-- this shit is considered false.
    a string with a space " "                   <-- this is considered true.
    0 or NULL or NaN or undefined or false      <-- these are all false. 

3. Booleans can be created as objects, but just don't do it. it isn't classy.
