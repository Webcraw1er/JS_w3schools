<!--
1. you can type either
        "use strict";
    or
        use strict
    to initiate strict mode.

    why use strict mode?
    -> it throws silent errors(mistakes that are silently not ran without notice) 
    and unhealthy syntaxes.

    1) there are many characteristics of strict mode, but the most renownded one is that
    it does not accept variables without declaration.
    2) octal chars
    3) deplicating a parameter name: not allowed.
    4) does not allow "this" keyword.
