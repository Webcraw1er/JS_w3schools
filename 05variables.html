<!-- 
1. var 은 ㅡ틀ㅡ 버전. 1996년 이전의 os에서 돌아가려면 var써야 한다.
     그 외에 var 과 let 차이는 없음.
    
2. const is unchangeable.
    Let and var are changeable.

3. all JS variables must be identified with unique names.
    can contain and start with $ and _, but cannot start with numbers.
    are case sensitive.

4. the "=" operator is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. (equal to operator : ==)
    in algebra, 
        x= x+5;
    desn't make any sense.
    however in Js, it does.
        x= x+5;
    will assign x+5 to x, which eventually leads to an increment of "x" by 5.

5. Declaring a variable: 
        you can declare many variables at once.
            ex) let carname= "volvo",owner= 'Justin', price= 200;

6. if a variable is declared withut a value, its value will be "undefined"
    if it is redeclared like 
        let car ="volvo";
        let car
    it will inherit the previous value.
        actually no because you cannot redeclare let and const, 
        ONLY VAR CAN BE REDECLARED.

7. + operator concatenates strings.

8. JS variables can be shown in the debug console via 
    console.log(); method.
