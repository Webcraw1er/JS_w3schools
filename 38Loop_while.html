<!--
1. while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    syntax:
        while(condition) { code block }

    If you forget the increment of the variable used in the condition, it will go into an endless loop
    and therefore crash your browser.
    
2. "do while" loop
    the do while syntax will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true,
    and then repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
    syntax:
        do { code block } while(condition);
