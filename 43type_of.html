<!--
1. JS has 5 different data types that can contain values.
    string
    number
    boolean 
    object 
    function

        AND IN OBJECTS THERE ARE 6 TYPES.
            OBJECT
            DATE
            ARRAY
            STRING
            NUMBER
            BOOLEAN

    AND TWO MORE TYPES THAT CANNOT CONTAIN VALUES.
        null
        undefined

2. typeof operator is used to find the data type of a JS variable.

3. the "null" returning as an object is a huge bug.
    the arrays returning as objects is because in JS, arrays ARE objects.

4. A variable without a value, has a value "undefined", and the type also, "undefined".
    ANY VARIABLE can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. upon doing this, the type will 
    also be "undefined".

    empty values, like
        let cars="";
    has nothing to do with undefined. 
    an emtpy string has both legal values and types.

5. "null" is supposed to mean nothing, but in JS it is an "object"
    consider this as a critical bug.

    typeof undefined    //undefined
    typeof null         // object
    null=== undefined   //false
    null== undefined    //true
