<!--
1. .toString() method
    converts an array to a string of array values.

    .join(" seperator ") method 
        does almost the same with toString, but one difference is that the join method
        specifies the seperator.

2. .pop() method
    pops out the last element and then returns its value.

    .push() method
    adds an element at the end of an array and reeturns the array's length.

3. .shift() method
        is equivalent to pop(), but works on the first element instead of the last.
        removes the first elemnet and moves the rest to a lower index.
    .unshift() method
        adds am element at the beginnning and unshifts older materials.
        it returns a  new array length.

4. deleting an element:
    you can use the delete keyword,
        ex) delete arr1[2]
    but you leave out "undefined" hols in the array.

    use shift() or pop() instead.
    
5. .concat() method creates a new array by merging existing arrays.
        it always creates and returns a new array.
        can also take strings as arguments.
    
        YOU MUST RETURN THE ARRAY TO SOMETHING because it needs address
        to store the newly created array.
            for ex), if you 
                        name4.concat("celly");
                    the name is not stored.
                    but if you 
                        name4= name4.concat("celly");
                    it is stored into "name4 array".
                    
6.  slicing() and splicing()

        splice() adds new items to an array.
            ex) fruit.splice(2, 1, "lemon", "Mango");
                first parameter "2" defines the position where new elements should be added in.
                second parameter "1" defines how many elements should be removed.
                the rest of the parameters indicates the elements pushed into the array.
                the return values are the elements delleted from the array.
                if you use it cleverly with no elements to add, you can delete items with mo "spaces."
                    ex) arr.splice(2, 1);  -> this erases the third element of "arr" array.
        
        slice() slices out a piece of an array. 
            it returns a "sliced" array
            ex) const newarr= arr.slice(2);  -> will slice the "arr" starting from index 2, and
                                                save the new array in newarr.
            while splice() manipulates the original array and could erase elements, slice() never 
            touches the original and only ends up returning the new sliced array.
            ex) const newarr2= arr.slice(2,5) -> will slice the array starting from index 2, up
            to (but not including) index 5.                        

7. all JS objects have a toString() method.
