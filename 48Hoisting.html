<!--
!!! remember that
    var x;      <---- this is the declaration
    x= 5;       <---- this is the assignment.

1. Hoisting is JS's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope/function

    HOWEVER, variables defined with "let" and "const" are hoisted, but not initialized.
        -> this means that the block of code is aware of the variable, but cannot use until its declared.

 2. ALSO, JS does not hoist initializations.
        -> WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT you can 
            x= 7;
            document.write(x);
            var x;

        BUT YOU CAN'T
            document.write(x);
            var x;
            x=7;
        or
            document.write(x);
            var x=7;

        Do you see the differnece? the first example did work because there was nothing wrong,
        but the second and third ones initialized the variable later, 
        which is not relfected when hoisting.
            to elaborate, in the third one, the JS did know that there is a declared variable "x", 
            but it is not initialized.
