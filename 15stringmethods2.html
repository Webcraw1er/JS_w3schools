<!--
1. All string methods return a new string. they dont modify the original string.
    SO strings are immutable. can't be changed, only replaced.

2. trim() only deletes the white spaces of both sides.

3. padStart(num1, str1);
    pads the start of the string with str1, fills it until the whole string length reaches num1.

4. there are 3ways of extracting string characters.
    1. charAt(position)
        output is the character in the index of the "position" parameter.
    2. charCodeAt(position)
        output is the unicode of the character in the index of the "position" parameter.
    3. Property access[ ]
        ex) let char=text9[2];

5. convert string into array
    .split("str") method 
        will split the string as well as converting it to an array.
        
        eventually ending up having a 2nd dimension array,
            ex) if the original string is 
                    let str1= "by the people, for the people, and of the people";
                and you 
                    let str2= str1.split(",");
                then str2 has 3 array elements as strings., 
                array[0] as "by the people"
                array[1] as "for the people"
                array[2] as "and of the people"

    spliting a text with "" will divide the whole text into an array of single characters.
