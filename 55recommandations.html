<!--

1. always declare arrays with "const".
    the JS will sometimes change variables or object types automatically.
    to prevent this, ban the redeclaration with the "const" keyword.
        ex) var arr= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
            arr= 4;
        will change the array into a number variable.
        arr.length() or arr[0] will no longer work. 

2. take look: 
        for( int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
    this block of code will access the length property every time going through the iteration.
    HOWEVER
        let len = arr.length;
        for( let i = 0; i< len; i++){
    will only compare(not access) the length as the block runs.

3. reduce DOM access. ( DOM is a standard for how to get, change, and delete HTML elements.)
        accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, so you can just declare a variable like this:
            const obj= document.getElementById("test1");
            obj.innerHTML= "Hello";
4. dont declare unneccessary variables.
    just use raw values when you don't need to use it over and over.
