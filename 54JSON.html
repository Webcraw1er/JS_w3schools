<!--
1. JSON is an abbreviation of (JAvascript Object Notation).
2. is used for storing and transporting data.(when data is sent from a server to a web page.)
3. is a lightweight data interchange format.
4. is language independent
        it is a pure text, so every computer languages can read JSON data.
5. JSON is self-describing and easy to understand.

6. JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JS objects.
    Thus is easier to convert into native JS objects.

    the following is an example Of a JSON, which shares the same charecteristics with a JS object,
        ex)
            {
                "employees": [
                    {"firstname":"John", "lastname": "choi"},
                    {"firstname":"Justin", "lastname": "Kim"}
                ]
            }
        
    IN JSON, 
        - DATA IS WRITTEN IN NAME/VALUE PAIRS, IN DOUBLE QUOTES.
                JS allows both single/double quotes, JSON does not.
        - DATA IS SEPERATED BY COMMAS.
        - CURLY BRACES HOLD OBJECTS.
        - SQUARE BRACKETS HOLD ARRAYS.
        - just like in JS, objects can obtain multiple name/value pairs.
        - just like in JS, an array can contain objects.

7. THE USAGE OF JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.
    for simplicity, this can be demonstrated using a string as input.
        first, create a JS string containing JSON syntax.
                ex) let text= '{ "employees": [' + 
                                '{  "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe" },' +
                                '{  "firstName": "Anna", "lastName": "Smith" },' +
                                '{  "firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Jones" } ]}';

        then, use the JS built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JS object
                ex) const obj1= JSON.parse(text);
        
        finally, use the JS object in your page.
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML= "the name is : " + text[1].firstName;

8. when writing a JSON string, you sometimes want to break a line.
        use a backslash when you want to do t\
        hat. just like this.
