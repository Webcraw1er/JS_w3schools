<!-- 
1. For in statement loops through the properties of an object.
    syntax:
        for (key in object){ code block }
    
    in the code above, 
        1) the "for in " loop iterates over the person object.
        2) each iteration returns a key(x)
        3) the key is used to access the value of the key
        4) the value of the key is person[x]

2. for in
        can also loop through the properties of an array.

        BUT the use of for in is not recommended because the array value may not be accessed 
        as the expected order.
        Rather, use for || for of || Array.forEach() loop.

3. .forEach() calls a function(a callback function) once for each array element.
    forEach() in particular accepts upto three arguments, which are value, index, and array itself.
    that's why the above example is written like that.
