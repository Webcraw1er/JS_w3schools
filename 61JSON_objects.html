<!--
1. in JSON strings, all str types must be surrounded by " ".
    in both JS and JSON, all keys must be a string, and all values a valid data type.
                                                                    ex) string
                                                                        number
                                                                        object  
                                                                        array 
                                                                        boolean
                                                                        null
    the only difference is that JS does not put " " for keys; they know that the keys ARE STRINGS anyway.
    but JSON has a very strict form, all keys must come inside " ".

    these properties of a JSON "string" is called "literals".
    in programming, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code.

2. you can access object values with both dot(.) and square brackets ([ ])
    when using square brackets, you must put " " too.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!for in loops through indexes(keys)     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                        so you need [ ] when accessing with "for in" loop.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!for of loops through values            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3. arrays in JSON uses the same syntax.
    '["ford", "BMW", "FIAT"]'
        this is the same with JS literal, ["ford", "BMW", "FIAT"]

    you can put arrays in an object.
