1. comparison operators
    GIVEN THAT x= 5;

==	    equal to	                    x == 8	    false	
                                        x == 5	    true	
                                        x == "5"	true	
===	    equal value and equal type	    x === 5	    true	
                                        x === "5"	false	
!=	    not equal	                    x != 8	    true	
!==	    not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false	
                                            x !== "5"	true	
                                            x !== 8	true	
>	    greater than	                x > 8	    false	
<	    less than	                    x < 8	    true	
>=  	greater than or equal to	    x >= 8	    false	
<=	    less than or equal to	        x <= 8  	true

2. logical operators
operator    description     
&&          and             (x<10 && y<5)
||          or              (x==5 || y==3)
!           not             !(x==y)             <-- this one's true!

3. Conditional(ternary) operator

    Can also assign different values on a variable based on some situations.
    syntax: variableName= (condition) ? value1 : value2;
    
4. When a number is compared to other types like string, it returns NaN, which is always false.
    When a couple numbers are compared as strings, "12" is smaller than "2",. which is set according
    to the alphabetic order.

    to prevent this, you must change the string to a number, using Number() function.
        ex) let x;
            x= Number(x)

5. isNaN:
        if the given parameter is a number, return false.
        if not a number returns true.(cause NaN is a abbr. of Not a Number).
