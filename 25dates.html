<!--
1. by default, the JS displays the date in full strings, via the built-in .toString() method.

2. there are four ways to create a new date object:
        1. new Date();
        2. new Date(year, month, ...);
                 the given parameters represent respectively year, month, day, hour, minute, second, ms
                 you can just give a few numbers and omit the rest if want, 
                BUT if you write only one parameter, it is regarded as a millisecond, thus the new Date()
                itself is interpreted as 4.  
        3. new Date(dateString);
        4. new Date(milliseconds);
            1 day is 86,400,000 ms.

3. JS automatically converts the date to strings with the inbuilt tostring(), but you can do somethings.
    toUTCString()   :   converts a date to a UTC string.
    toDateString()  :   makes the JS to write the date into a more readable form,
