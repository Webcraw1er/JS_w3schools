1. It has become a common practice to declare arrays with "const".
    arrays declared with const cannot be reassigned.
    arrays declared with const must be initialized when it is declared.
                                       (assigned a value)

    has block scope, meaning that it can't be seen outside the block.

    even it is declared with var, it cannot be redeclared with const.
