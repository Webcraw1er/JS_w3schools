<!--
1. JS classes are temlpates of objects.
    * use the keyword "class" to create a class.
    always add a method named constructor();

    the syntax is as follows:
        class ClassName {
            constructor() { ... }
        }

    ex)
        class car {
            constructor(name, year) {
                this.name = name;
                this.year = year;
            }
        }

        1) the name of the class is "car"
        2) the two initial properties are "name" and "year".
        3) JS class is not an object, 
            but a template for objects.                        
        4) class constructors should be invoked with "new" keyword.
            (1) the constructor method should be named exactly as "constructor".
            (2) is called automatically when a new object is created.\
            (3) used to initialize object properties.
            (4) if not defined, JS will add an empty "constructor method"
